In this project [Plant-Disease-Detection] We will construct an End to End project based on Pure Deep Learning in this tutorial. You'll learn why I'm using the term "Pure" in my next few columns. This project was built with the intention of detecting or identifying the various diseases that might affect potato leaves. because Convolutional Neural Network can readily classify them but our unaided vision cannot. You won't believe it when I tell you that the top 5% error of human eyesight is even lower than the error of some pre-trained Neural Network Architectures, which has an error of about 3%. The human top-5 inaccuracy on large-scale photographs has been observed to be 5.1%, which which outperforms previously trained networks.Problem Statement for Prediction of Potato Leaf Disease Each year, many diseases that infect potato plants create substantial financial losses for farmers that grow potatoes. The two most common illnesses are Early Blight and Late Blight. Both early and late blight are brought on by distinct microorganisms, but if farmers can identify the illness early and treat it well, they can avoid a lot of waste and financial loss. It's critical to correctly identify the type of disease present in that potato plant because there are certain differences between the treatments for early and late blight. Convolutional Neural Network - Deep Learning will be used in the background to diagnose plants disease.
